# Implementation of the Architecture

We implemented the components of the Application, Middleware and Perception layers using Eclipse Vert.x API and third-party components. 
Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building applications on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
One of the advantages of Vert.x compared to other technologies (e.g. Akka, Ratpack) is the provision of a set of APIs to design applications in different languages. 
In addition, Vert.x has a better performance than Akka and other frameworks in some benchmarks such as TechEmpower.
